This tool allows you to query NIHR-supported projects and receive a summary of research relevant to your query.  
- Select **Infrastructure**, **Programmes**, or **Both**.  
- Enter your **Google API Key** (can be generated at "https://aistudio.google.com/apikey").
- Enter your **query**, e.g., "novel drug delivery device".  
- Specify the **focus** of the summary (optional), e.g., "the organisations undertaking the work", "do not talk about the researchers", or "group projects by their intended aim".  
- Specify the **number of closest matches** to consider, use more for broader topics.  
- Press **Start** to generate the summary.  
- **Export the results** as CSV or TXT files.  

**Please note:** 
- **Language models can make errors, only use these results as an overview and validate prior to sharing further.**
- Infrastructure supported projects only include those supported in **2022/23** and **2023/24**.
- Programme awards are only those available on **NIHR Open Data**.
- **Output csv files will simply show the results the summary has been generated using**, sorted by descending semantic similarity to the query, and may either show many **false positives** (selected number of results too high) or **miss relevant research** (selected number of results too high).

**CONTEXT**
- Below, you have been provided a set of **projects** supported by National Institute for Health and Care (NIHR) infrastructure.
- You have been provided the project titles, research summaries, with the centre and year the project took place.
- There may be duplicated projects where they are supported across multiple years or multiple centres.


**TASK**
- Using only the projects listed below, provide an easy to read summary, grouping by common themes, of the research directly relevant to the query: "{query}"

**INSTRUCTIONS**
- Where possible, discuss work from all schemes - so BRCs, MICs, ARCs, PSTRCs and so on, these are determined by the 'centre name' which will have location and scheme in the name.
- Unless specified in the focus, limit response to 500 words. 
- If no projects are relevant to the query, say so.
- Try to advertise NIHR positively, linking between the sources to show how NIHR supports innovation across the translational pathway. 
- Link together centres and researchers when it is the same project where appropriate.
- Ensure that you write in a neutral scientific tone, being as accurate as possible, while still aiming to capture the audience's attention. 
- Only talk about the evidence you are presented with in the prompt, but make the links between projects whenever possible.
- Make sure the text is easy to take the main points away from. Where useful, use bold text, bullet points, and section headings. 
- Try and talk about aims and potential benefits of the research as much as possible.
- Talk around the projects and make links, I do not want just a list.
- Make sure you don't repeat yourself.
- If there are a lot of relevant projects, just talk about the most interesting and the common themes.
