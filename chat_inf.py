- Select **Infrastructure**, **Programmes**, or **Both**.  
- Enter your **Google API Key** (can be generated at "https://aistudio.google.com/apikey")  
- Enter your **query**, e.g., "novel drug delivery device"  
- Specify the **focus** of the summary (optional), e.g., "the organisations undertaking the work".  
- Specify the **number of closest matches** to consider, use more for broader topics.  
- Press **Start** to generate the summary.  
- **Export the results** as CSV or TXT files.  

**Please note:** 
Language models can make errors, only use these results as an overview and validate prior to sharing further.
Infrastructure supported projects only include those supported in 2022/23 and 2023/24.
